# Web App Setup - React/Next.js Version

## Quick Start

We'll create a modern web app using React/Next.js that:
- ✅ Works in any browser
- ✅ Uses your existing Epic Client ID
- ✅ Implements Epic OAuth with PKCE
- ✅ Shows all the same features (Login, Dashboard, Labs, Medications, Appointments)
- ✅ No Flutter needed!

## What We'll Build

- **Frontend:** React/Next.js with TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (modern, responsive)
- **OAuth:** Epic SMART on FHIR with PKCE
- **State Management:** React Context/State
- **API Calls:** Fetch API

## Project Structure

└── package.json          # Dependencies
```

## Next Steps

I'll create the web app structure for you. Would you like me to:

1. **Create the full React/Next.js app** with all features?
2. **Start with a simple HTML/JS version** first (faster to test)?
3. **Create just the Epic OAuth integration** first?

Let me know and I'll start building!
